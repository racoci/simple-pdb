# AGENTS: Profile Detail

This directory contains the component for viewing a single profile.

- `ProfileComponent` fetches profile data via `ProfileService` using the route ID.
- Keep the `profileData` structure based on `ProfileResponse` when extending fields.
- Ensure the back button continues to navigate to the NPC simulation.
